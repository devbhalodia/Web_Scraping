# Web_Scraping
This repo contains two web scraping projects using Python and BeautifulSoup: one scrapes book details (title, price, rating, availability) from books.toscrape.com, and the other extracts IPL 2022 auction data (player status, team, and prices) from a cricket auction site. Data is parsed, cleaned, and saved using pandas.
